go to code directory and run:
* g++ run.cpp && ./a.out

after you quit, two files will be generated:
* wrong_freq_table_desc.txt
* wrong_list.txt

if you want to retest using wrong_list.txt, do:
* cp wrong_list.txt page_x
* mv page_x ../parsed
* re-run and type 'x' when prompted which page to choose.
